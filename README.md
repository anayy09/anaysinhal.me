## Features

### Dynamic Content with ReactJS

I've harnessed the power of ReactJS to create a responsive and visually appealing website. This framework has enabled me to build a modern and user-friendly interface that seamlessly adapts to different screen sizes. This means that whether you're viewing the portfolio on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, you'll have an optimized and consistent experience.

### Integration of Hashnode API

To keep my portfolio up-to-date with my latest blog posts, I've integrated the Hashnode API. This feature automatically fetches and displays my most recent blogs on the website. This ensures that visitors to my portfolio have easy access to my latest insights and writings, keeping them informed about my ongoing work.

### Interactive Contact Form with EmailJS

I've implemented EmailJS to create an interactive and dynamic contact form on my portfolio. This feature makes it easy for visitors to get in touch with me while providing a smooth and user-friendly experience. When you send a message through the form, it is delivered directly to my email inbox, ensuring prompt and reliable communication.
